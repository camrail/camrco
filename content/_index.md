Lesson 1: accidentally in production.  

Step 1 - When you're new to coding, start a new repo with your hello world.  Next, be lazy enough to continue to use the same repo for all subsequent projects as you learn.  Finally, continue to use that same repo as your project gains traction, eventually taking that same repo through to the project being acquired.
