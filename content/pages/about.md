## Me in HD

Hi - I'm Cam.  I'm a bit late to the party which means I started learning all things coding when I was towards 30.  I worked the first ten years of my professional life
as a stock trader, eventually ending up on the proprietary trading desk of an Investment Bank in London.  After many hops, trading a variety of instruments and pouring years into becoming a Chartered Financial Analyst, it
started to all look the same and I wanted to move into something which was more dynamic.  

I launched [Stackup Risk](https://www.stackup.io), which is an investment risk profiling company.  Having initially started coding to build that product, and having no idea what I was doing,
fast forward 5 years after it has been acquired and I have (a bit) more idea what I'm doing!  As the the sole developer (and sole everything-er as a company of 1), I had to learn a broad range of technologies fairly quickly to scale that into a production environment.

I'm now working as a Product Development Lead for AMP Bank for the company which acquired Stackup, and given I am not coding for my full-time job anymore I'm using camr.co as my outlet to continue to code and document my learnings.
