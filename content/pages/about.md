Hi - I'm Cam.  I'm a bit late to the party which means I started learning all things coding after pushing 30.  I worked the first ten years of my professional life
as a stock trader, eventually ending up on the proprietary trading desk of an Investment Bank in London.  After a few hops and trading a variety of instruments, it
started to look all the same and I wanted to move into something which was more dynamic.  

I started [Stackup Risk](www.stackup.io), which is an investment risk profiling company, as a side hustle.  Having initially started coding to build that product, and having no idea what I was doing,
fast forward 4 years and it has now been acquired and I still have no idea what I'm doing.  BUT, as I was the sole developer, I did have to learn a broad range of technologies fairly quickly to scale that into a production environment.

I'm now working as a Product Development Lead for the company which acquired Stackup, and given I am not coding for my full-time job anymore I'm using camr.co as my outlet to continue to code and document my learnings.
