## Me in HD

Hi - I'm Cam and I live in Sydney, Australia.  I'm a bit late to the coding party which means I started learning all things development when I was towards 30.  But, this isn't my first gig.  

I've been a highly motivated creator since I was a wee lad, having worked my teen years in event lighting design and then founding a video production company called [Kaptivate](https://vimeo.com/44019418).

After being encouraged to get a real job I worked the next ten years as a stock trader, eventually ending up on the proprietary trading desk of an Investment Bank in London.  I traded a variety of instruments and poured years into becoming a Chartered Financial Analyst, but it started to all look the same after a while.  

> I wanted to move back into something creative and dynamic, but also didn't want to give up what comes naturally to me - the quantiative and logical.  App development, coding, was the answer.

I launched [Stackup Risk](https://www.stackup.io), a psychometric investment risk profiling company.  Having initially started coding to build that product, and having no idea what I was doing,
fast forward 5 years, Stackup has been acquired, and I now have a vague idea what I'm doing ;-)  As the sole developer (and sole everything-er as a company of 1), I had to learn a broad range of technologies fairly quickly to scale into a production environment.

I'm now working as a Product Development Lead for AMP for the company which acquired Stackup, and given I am not coding for my full-time job anymore I'm using camr.co as my outlet to continue to create and document my learnings.
